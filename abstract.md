## Abstract
Assortativity coefficients are important metrics to analyze both directed and
undirected networks. In general, it is not guaranteed that the fitted network
will always agree with the assortativity coefficients in the given network and
the structure of directed networks is more complicated than the undirected ones.
Therefore, we provide a remedy by proposing a degree-preserving rewiring
algorithm, called DiDPR, for rewiring directed networks toward given directed
assortativity coefficients. We construct the joint degree distribution of the
target network by accounting for the four directed assortativity coefficients
simultaneously, provided that they are attainable, and obtain the desired joint
distribution by solving a convex optimization problem. Our algorithm also helps
check the attainability of the given assortativity coefficients.
